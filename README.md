I use React Native and Flutter to create most of our mobile applications. React Native is a modern tool from Facebook that lets you create native apps for both iOS and Android using one codebase. Flutter is a technology from Google for the same thing. Using such platforms reduces development and maintenance costs while allowing you to use any native functionalities — cameras, GPS, and anything else available for native apps. If needed we can also write in Java, Swift, or Kotlin for specific things. 

What I can do to make your project successful: 

🎯 I conduct a thorough Lean Inception or Project Discovery to validate your business idea early on 🎯 I analyze flowcharts, design or make code review and provide you with a detailed development plan together 🎯 You have budget limitations and need efficient and cost-saving development 🎯 You look for custom solutions to address your particular business objectives 🎯 You hesitate which of the mobile solutions (native or cross-platform) will work better for your project
